# Funny_Farm
Funny animal life on the farm. 

Given:
Animal farm. There are 3 types of animals fostered there: cows, pigs and chickens. There is a routine to animal's lifes.
In the morning they are being fed. Afternoons they spend playing and occasionally popping on the pastures, and in the evenings they are weighted.

When cow eats it gains 5 kg to its's weight, when chicken or pig eat they gain 0.5 kg and 2 kg respectively.

Pooping comes occasionally, which means that chicken poops with a chance of 100% each day, and cow and pig have 30% and 50% chances of pooping respectively. Pooping reduces animal's weight by 0.2 kg, 1.5 kg, 1 kg for chicken, cow and pig respectively.

Weighting, which comes last, checks if animals have reached a certain weight to be slaughtered and eaten. Cow is in the best condition for slaughtering when it reaches 300 kg, chicken when 5 kg, pig when 100 kg.

Required:
Simulate a week of life on a farm. One animal of each type could be slaughtered during the week (respecting chances). Each animal action should be displayed in console.
